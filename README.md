# Customer-Segmentation
## Basic customer segmentation and implementation of K-Means Clustering from scratch.

In this repo I have built a basic K-Means Clustering algorithm in python and have implemented it on the customer mall dataset downloaded from Kaggle:

I have used plotly to visualise the dataset using various scatter plots and violin plots and have finally trained the model on a selection of features. I have then tested the model against sklearns version of the K-Means Cluster algorithm to validate the mode I built from scratch.
